<!-- To do:

-fix button (link not working weirdly)



- Flex!!
So to align and organice images such as you can see in the pdf reference , we ask you working
width display:flex ,justify-content and align-items.

- Font-size and Media
Use em lenght and font-size property at least in two text elements (for example h1 and p)

- @media rule we be a must, so to adapt font-size when screen gets 768px or less

- IMP!! We do not force you to follow exactly quantity of columns as in the reference, but there must
be a design 12 column system created in the css.
For example,
the header in the reference is 100% of width since it takes full 12 column but you can decide
it takes 10 columns so to have 83.33% of width, or for instance images takes 3 columns each,
despite that you can decide working with images taking less o more columns at least this part
above should have two images.
Remember: 12 column grid an working with containers and % was seen on the 16th of and on
the 23rd of April class.
